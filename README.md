An R package for analyzing and clustering longitudinal data

### Description

The `akmedoids` package advances the clustering of longitudinal datasets
in order to identify clusters of trajectories with similar long-term
linear trends over time, providing an improved cluster identification as
compared with the classic kmeans algorithm. The package also includes a
set of functions for addressing common data issues, such as missing
entries and outliers, prior to conducting advance longitudinal data
analysis. One of the key objectives of this package is to facilitate
easy replication of a recent paper which examined small area inequality
in the crime drop (Adepeju et al.Â 2021). Many of the functions provided
in the `akmedoids` package may be applied to longitudinal data in
general.
