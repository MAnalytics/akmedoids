'Akmedoids' package updated (Version: v1.2.5)

### Updates:
1. Updated the `README.md` file to include clustering demonstration using a simulated dataset. 
2. Added 4 new sample datasets, and used in the function examples. The datasets include `clustr`, `simulated`, `TO1Risk`, `traj_w_space`.
3. Added detailed descriptions of fields in each dataset. See `format` section of each dataset documentation.
4. Change the citation `Adepeju et al. 2019` to `Adepeju et al. 2021` based on the newly published article upon which the `akmedoids` package is based.
5. Modified the names of some functions, e.g. `akmedoids.clust` changed to `akclustr`,  `statPrint` changed to `print_akstats`, `population` changed to `popl`.
6. Added two new functions, namely; `remove_rows_n`, `plot_akstats` (see the documentation for details)
7. Ensured that the names of functions are in lower cases, e.g. `dataImputation` changed to `data_imputation`, `outlierDetect` changed to `outlier_detect`, etc.


Your faithfully.
Monsuru.
